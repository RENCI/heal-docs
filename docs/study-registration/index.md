# Study Registration

The purpose of study registration is to link a study in the HEAL Platform to
several necessary pieces of information, including:

1. A study-level metadata instance within CEDAR,
2. A ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (if applicable), and
3. The name of the repository (or repositories) in which the study will be
   depositing data, along with the study-specific identifier(s) used by that
   repository.
