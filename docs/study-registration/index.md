# Study Registration

The HEAL Platform will serve as a central location for search and discovery of HEAL-funded and HEAL-relevant research. To help the Platform achieve that goal, investigators are asked to register their studies to make them discoverable. 

The purpose of study registration is to link a study in the HEAL Platform to several necessary pieces of information, including:

??? success "A study-level metadata instance within CEDAR"
   
      Regardless of whether I'm a data-savvy researcher, patient, clinician, economist, or policy-maker, whether I come from a focus on pain or opioid conditions, **study level metadata** enables quick and easy search and discovery for studies that might be producing datasets or findings of relevance (even before the study has started or data has been produced).

      **CEDAR** is an interactive form that allows investigators to fill out study-level metadata not available from existing linked sources (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov). It provides sets of controlled vocabulary, making the process easier on the investigator.


??? success "A ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (if applicable)"

      We know that investigators already provide study metadata to other sources (e.g. the NIH during the award application process, to **ClinicalTrials.gov** during the study registration process if the study is a reportable clinical trial). During the study registration process, investigators will provide links to these sources of existing metadata. The Platform will harvest this metadata, and use as much as possible to fulfill the HEAL Study-level Core Metadata requirements. Investigators will only be asked to provide the balance of metadata that cannot be harvested from existing sources.

!!! success "The name of the repository (or repositories) in which the study will be depositing data, along with the study-specific identifier(s) used by that repository."


Registering your study is a two-step process. To start, you will need to [request access](registering-your-study.md) to register your study. For this step, you will need your InCommon, ORCID, or Google log-in information as well as your name, email address, institutional affiliation, and role on the project/study.
