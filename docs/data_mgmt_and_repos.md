Data Management and Repositories
--------------------------------

As part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, the HEAL Platform securely exposes data stored on multiple HEAL-approved FAIR repositories, i.e. data libraries or archives. Thus, the aim of the platform is to provide an easy way to connect different repositories on one single location.

FAIR data repositories are traditionally a part of a larger institution established for research, data archiving, and, to serve data users of that organization.

For more information from NIH, see [https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data](https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data).

Currently, the HEAL platform makes data available from the following FAIR Data Resources or Repositories:

Studies from different Data Resources can be filtered and selected on the [Discovery Page](#Discovery) in the Study Characteristics section (top panel):

In the following, we list a short summary of datasets shared from each repository.

### HEAL

At this time, the HEAL Platform shares metadata of 565 studies from [https://heal.nih.gov/funding/awarded](https://heal.nih.gov/funding/awarded) (status Feb 2021) under the general tag "HEAL". As more data become available to the public, the metadata and datasets will be distributed to different FAIR repositories.

### Clinical Trials

ClinicalTrials.gov is a Web-based resource that provides patients, their family members, health care professionals, researchers, and the public with easy access to information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies on a wide range of diseases and conditions.
