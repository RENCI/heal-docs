2\. Types of hosted Data
------------------------

The HEAL Platform provides secure access to data that is the product of opioid research and will be the driving engine for new discovery.

On the highest level, the data hosted on the HEAL Platform range from study metadata that describe available datasets at a high-level to subject-level data. The types of data represented are diverse and include scientific research across multiple disciplines, as well as studies related to policy making and community service leadership. For example, researchers can use this single platform to find data ranging from clinical patient care data and public records to “omics” data files and associated sample collection and processing data.

The HEAL platform aims to make data more accessible by following the "FAIR" principles:

Findable

*   Researchers are provided an intuitive interface to search over metadata for HEAL studies and related datasets.
*   Each study and dataset will be assigned a unique, persistent identifier.

Accessible

*   Authenticated users can request and receive access to controlled-access data by data providers.
*   Metadata can be accessed via an open API.

Interoperable

*   Standard metadata vocabularies facilitate discovery and joint analysis of HEAL and related datasets. Data can
*   Data can be easily exported to various workspaces for analysis using a variety of software tools.

Reusable

*   Data can be easily reused to facilitate reproducibility of results, development and sharing of new tools, and collaboration between investigators.
