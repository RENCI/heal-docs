## Types of Hosted Data

As part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, the HEAL Platform aims to transform opioid research into a virtual, annotated, searchable catalog where data from different studies can be analyzed, compared, and combined.

The data presented on the HEAL Platform are diverse and include scientific research across multiple disciplines. For example, researchers can use this single platform to find clinical patient care data and public records as well as “-omics” data files with associated sample collection and processing data.

The HEAL platform aims to make data more accessible by following the "**FAIR**" principles:

**F**indable

*   Researchers are provided an intuitive interface to search over metadata for HEAL studies and related datasets.
*   Each study and dataset will be assigned a unique, persistent identifier.

**A**ccessible

*   Authenticated users can request and receive access to controlled-access data by data providers.
*   Metadata can be accessed via an open API.

**I**nteroperable

*   Standard metadata vocabularies facilitate discovery and joint analysis of HEAL and related datasets. Data can
*   Data can be easily exported to various workspaces for analysis using a variety of software tools.

**R**eusable

*   Data can be easily reused to facilitate reproducibility of results, development and sharing of new tools, and collaboration between investigators.

FAIR data repositories are traditionally a part of a larger institution established for research, data archiving, and, to serve data users of that organization.
